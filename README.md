Myntra as a Social Shopping Platform has a high potential to bring revolution in the future shopping experience. The E-commerce site would be no less than a social media interaction that would not only serve the customerâ€™s demands but would also come to aid small-scale businesses to grow and scale up widely.
Our model strives to build features that make Myntra a socially connecting platform, with some engaging features like: 
  - REELS REVIEW: that turns static product listings into vibrant, interactive showcases. 
  - CUSTOMIZED DESIGN SECTION: Customers can upload images and details of the clothing designs they desire. Small designers will then review these requests and reach out to potential clients, offering their services.
